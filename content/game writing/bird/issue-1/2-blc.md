## Bad Luck Charm, -1 Magical Amulet

Maybe it’s just a coincidence, you think. “Four this time,” you hear something that sounds like a thin version of your own voice. You’ve already set the coins on the table when the laughter starts. “Kid, you don’t know when to quit,” but he takes the gold all the same. “Evens again.”

“Seventh time’s the charm, I suppose.”

"It’s not a coincidence,” you plead at the temple steps. Tears run down your pallid features, over your sunken jaw. “You are always _just_ out of soup, _just_ out of alms. Is this not the temple of charity? What have I done to offend you and your god?”

The monk shrugs and digs through his pack, eventually retrieving a soft, rotten apple. Your mouth waters as you reach for it. He pulls back, pointing to the wooden heirloom you wear around your neck. Without hesitation, you hand over the last connection to your long-deceased family.

When you bite into the mealy, black flesh of the apple, it’s the greatest thing you’ve ever tasted. Things are finally looking up.

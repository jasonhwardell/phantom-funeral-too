This is the place for the triflings of Phantom Funeral Press, an illusory imprint from the remains
of Dayton, Ohio, USA. Browse adventures, shorter things, and blogs just over there on the menu. You
can do it!

The site design and implementation is done using Mikey Lombardi's [platen.io](https://platen.io/).
It is a good design and I like it.

## /now - January 2025

- Rebuilding my platen site. It's fun!
- Thinking about lowest-tech zine creation.
- Probably some more things.

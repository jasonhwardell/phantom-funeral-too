## the Bird of Passage: Issue One

### Prelude

The parchment cracks and sheds as you flatten it on the sitting-room table. Every edition has an air of antiquity about it. The Bird of Passage, volume unknown, issue unknown. Print run of two, or perhaps two hundred thousand. This one arrived today, rolled tightly and slipped into your daypack at some point during your morning errands. Who delivered it? Don’t ask stupid questions.

Some of the contents make you wince, or smile, or gasp in disbelief. Some excerpts take you back to your childhood. Others dig up ancestral memories predating your great grandparents. Still others conjure sights and thoughts from unknown distances and times yet to occur. Every word sticks like a barb, ripping parts of you away as you move to the next.

You tightly roll the parchment and return it to your daypack as soon as you finish reading, careful to not introduce any further damage. This one has three, maybe four reads left. Departing into the night, you meander through the streets until you find the tavern with the right look. At the bar, a silver-haired woman scribbles intently in her journal. You slide the rolled parchment into her cloak pocket as you pass. You find a seat further down the bar and order a drink. It’ll do for now.
